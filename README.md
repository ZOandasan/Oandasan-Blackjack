Black Jack

Game Objective: Get more points than the dealer without going over 21.

Game Scoring: Each face card is worth 10 points. Each number card is worth the value of the card (the 2 of clubs is worth 2 points, the 10 of diamonds is worth 10 points). Aces are worth either 1 or 11 points, whichever provides more points to the hand.

Playing the Game: You start a hand of Blackjack by placing a bid (in this case $5, $10 or $20.) From there, both you and the dealer are dealt two cards. The first card of both hands is hidden to the other players at the table. You can then choose to add another card to your hand (Hit), or keep your current hand, locking it in (Stand). After all other players have chosen to Stand, the dealer will take Hits until he his at or above 17 points, at which point he will stand. The winner is then decided, and the bids distributed to
